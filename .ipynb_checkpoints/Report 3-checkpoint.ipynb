An example of a choropleth map commonly seen could be an election map with red and blue shades indicating votes across the country, as seen below (source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/2016_Nationwide_US_presidential_county_map_shaded_by_vote_share.svg) <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/2016_Nationwide_US_presidential_county_map_shaded_by_vote_share.svg'>"
